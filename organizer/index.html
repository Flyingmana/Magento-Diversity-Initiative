<h3>What you can do as an Event Organizer</h3>

<p>
    As an organizer of a Magento centred Event you have a big reach inside and also around the community,
    and you also build a big part of the public image of the community.
    The amount of diversity this events show
    is for many the only insight about the diversity level the Community reached.
    So as a Community we have a strong interest to help you on this topic.
