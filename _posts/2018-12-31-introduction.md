title: Introduction to the Diversity Initiative
author: Flyingmana

I am watching the Diversity situation around Magento,
and especially the MeetMagento events very carefully for a bit more than a year now.
I have heard about several efforts,
from official side, event organizer side, and also from inside the Community.
And I have also seen the results, or mostly the lack of them.
Which may be caused by my very limited view I have from the outside.  
So the first goal this initiative has:  
***make the results of the diversity efforts measurable by setting verifiable goals.***

<!--more-->

Diversity is a lot about visibility, so changes which are public visible have the highest impact and should be valued accordingly.  
Diversity is also mostly a Community Topic, so participating in any form should be made as easy as possible for the whole community and not happen behind closed doors. For this reason, ***the Initiative will document all its own efforts publicly in this Website and the Github Repository behind it***. So it is easy for everyone to contribute but also questioning certain efforts which may be contra productive.

One thing I heard this year from multiple event organizers, they want to improve the Diversity Situation,
but they dont know how, or what they try does not work.
This is not surprising, the same I have heard from other Companies and Communities already several years ago.
Here is [one example from 2015](https://philsturgeon.uk/feminism/2015/08/17/women-speaker-ratio-conversation-loop/) describing the problems.
And usually there were several suggestions from the community. And also examples from other communities, which had successfull diversity efforts. Let me name the [JSConf EU 2018](https://2018.jsconf.eu/speakers/) as an example.  
So another Goal of the Initiative is: ***provide manuals, guidelines and recommendations, to increase the diversity in conferences in the Area of Speakers, and also attendees***.  
Also we already started with a [list of usefull Links]({{ site.baseurl }}/link-collection.html) about the Diversity topic, if you want to read more, or even have links to contribute.

Obviously this is not the first magento related promotion for diversity.
To list a few:

The Initiative will be a bit different, as it is intended to be a longrunning project.
Also, while most efforts are currently centred around woman, we will also take on the other areas of diversity later.
To bring in a personal anecdote: I did grow up and did go to school in Berlin, Germany. For the 14 Years I did go to school, I was constantly surrounded by a very diverse group of pupils. And it is still iritating me, in how many dimensions the Magento Community is lacking this diversity I am used to.

For the list I also have to mention the [Diversity Page of Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/diversity.html), to show Diversity is also for the new owner of the Magento Company an important topic.
